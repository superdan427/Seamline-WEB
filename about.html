        <p>Scrolling. Comparing. Ego-maxing. Saving posts. Saving sewing guides. Saving “inspiration” you’ll never open again. It feels like doing something. It isn’t.</p>
        <p>Seamline was created to get you outside. Touch some grass. Feel some actual fabric. Find small shops you didn’t know existed.</p>
        <p>It’s a directory that gets you off your phone and into the real world. Fabric shops, suppliers, tailors. Places and people fashion is built on and depends on.</p>
        <p>Seamline is a starting point. Pick a place. Go there. Touch the fabric. Make something.</p>
        <p>We’re not here for aesthetic posturing. Seamline helps you find fabric shops so you can start making clothes. Simple as.</p>
        <p>Because as we all know fashion students are the most important people in the world.</p>
        <p>They know everything about everything.</p>
        <p>And without them, especially the East London creatives, civilisation would collapse.</p>
        <p>Less content. Less ego. Less gatekeeping.</p>
        <p>Make something.</p>
